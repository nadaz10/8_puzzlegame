## Introduction
The 8-puzzle is a classic problem in artificial intelligence where the goal is to rearrange a 3x3 grid of numbered tiles to a specific goal state by sliding tiles into the empty space. This project provides implementations of different search algorithms to solve the puzzle and visualize the solution.

## Features
- Solve the 8-puzzle using BFS, DFS, and A* algorithms.
- Visualize the solution path using Pygame.
- Interactive user interface for shuffling and solving the puzzle.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pygame (for visualization)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/8-puzzle-solver.git
   cd 8-puzzle-solver
2. pip install pygame
## Algorithms:
The project includes implementations of the following algorithms:

Breadth-First Search (BFS): Explore the puzzle states level by level.
Depth-First Search (DFS): Explore the deepest nodes in the search tree first.
A algorithm:* Use a heuristic to estimate the cost from the start to the goal.
